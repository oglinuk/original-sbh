# SaltBaeHash

## Security through obscurity

### Next level of password security
#### Plain text ->
#### n(0 < n < infinity) cipher(s) applied ->
#### n(0 < n < infinity) rotation(s) ->
#### n(0 < n < infinity) amount of potential hashs ->
#### store in a password manager if needed

# Installation

Install [Windows Python 3.6.3](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.3/Python-3.6.3.exe)

Linux has both Python3 and Python2 installed by default, so you might just need to update to the latest version of Python3.

Install [Windows Git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.15.0.windows.1/Git-2.15.0-64-bit.exe)

or

```
sudo apt install git -y
```

<b>To clone the program</b> - git clone https://github.com/OGLinuk/sbh.git

Navigate to where you cloned SaltBaeHash in cmd or terminal

## Benefits
* Free
* Easy to use
* <b><i>Very</i></b> secure

## Milestones

* Add the ability to apply an automation to the assignment
of the rotations which could be stored as say a private key. This would make numbers 2 < digits easier to use
* Add more cipher methods as options
* Add the option to generate sha512 hashs rather than sha256
